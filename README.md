**PHASE ONE MOVIES PROJECT**

 Prediction project overview

**Introduction**

Very well!Lets go.

![awesome](https://github.com/winnycodegurl/Ds-Phase1--Movies-Project/assets/162214319/a2b093d4-bc0c-4b4d-b02c-8af59d553990)


This is a data science project aimed at helping Microsoft , a new movie company, establish what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office.The findings are the translated into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

 **Overview**
  
Our main goal is to create the best selling movies in the industry.The four main objectives are:
  Research Box Office Trends:
  Analyze recent box office hits to identify genres, themes, and characteristics that have performed well. This analysis can involve studying successful films across different genres, budget ranges, and target audiences.

Consider Audience Preferences: Understand the preferences of different demographic groups, such as age, gender, and geographical location. This can help in tailoring movie concepts to specific target audiences.

Analyze Market Data: Look at market research reports and industry analyses to understand broader trends in the film industry, including emerging genres, audience preferences, and global market opportunities. 

Explore Collaborations: Consider partnerships or collaborations with established filmmakers, directors, writers, or production companies who have a track record of success in creating box office hits.

**Projet Structure**

1.Data Exploration

Exploring the data sets to understand the available information  and identify relevant features.

2.Data Cleaning

Preprocessing the data to ensure its quqlity and sustainability for analysis

3.Data Analysis

Utilize data Science techniques to analyse the data seta and extract meaningful insights.

Data VIsualization
Develop  graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

**Technologies Used**

Python

pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

SQL

Jupyter Notebook

**File Description**

data/:bom.movie_gross.csv.gz,im.db,
Directory containing the input datasets (movies.csv, actors.csv, viewers.sql)
